# Security Policy

This security policy is a critical document that outlines the security measures and guidelines that govern participation and contribution to this repository. It is absolutely mandatory for all new users, contributors, and anyone intending to interact with this project in any capacity to carefully and thoroughly read, understand, and acknowledge this security policy before engaging in any activities related to the repository.

Taking the time to fully grasp and internalize these security guidelines is of paramount importance. This ensures that every individual involved, regardless of their role or level of contribution, possesses a clear, consistent, and comprehensive understanding of the specific security practices, procedures, and preventative measures that are implemented to safeguard the project and its valuable assets. This shared foundation of knowledge is not merely beneficial, but absolutely critical for fostering and maintaining a secure, protected, and collaborative environment for all members of the community, promoting trust, and mitigating potential risks.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the unfortunate event that you, as a user or contributor, happen to identify or suspect the existence of a security vulnerability, weakness, or potential security flaw within the repository's code, infrastructure, or any related component, it is of utmost importance and a strict requirement that you report this vulnerability exclusively and solely through the designated and secure security tab provided within the repository's interface.

Under no circumstances whatsoever should security vulnerabilities, potential exploits, or any related security concerns be reported via public channels such as issues, pull requests, discussions, or any other publicly accessible communication forum. This restriction is deliberately and intentionally enforced as a protective measure to shield and defend the repository from potential exploitation and malicious activities carried out by nefarious individuals, including malicious hackers, cybercriminals, and other threat actors who might attempt to take advantage of publicly visible vulnerabilities for their own illicit purposes. Adhering strictly and without exception to this specified reporting procedure plays a vital and indispensable role in preserving the overall security, integrity, and confidentiality of the project, ensuring that any potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities are managed responsibly, effectively, and with the appropriate level of discretion, minimizing the potential for harm and maintaining the trust of our users and contributors.
